480,Fri May 27 20:57:27 +0000 2022,"IMO there are NO indications a “bottom” for #Bitcoin is in.

It’s a slow grind down to 200 WSMA (around $22,000).

But!  I believe low $20ks *could be* the new $100k #BTC we believed in last year.

So $22k will either be front run by the 200 WEMA ($26.9k) or $BTC breaks to $19k.",1,10,EmmyMoonie,6644,1530292120430714880
