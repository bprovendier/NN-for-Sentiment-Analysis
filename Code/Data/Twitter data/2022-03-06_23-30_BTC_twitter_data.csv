482,Sun Mar 06 22:56:55 +0000 2022,@i9theghost5 Remember when I said all I was looking at was the weeklies?  I hate to say the intuition was right. We all need to be careful. Down to 29-30k? 25-26k? Or just 35-36k? Doubt this ends well without a strong reversal or some time to build a base. I’d buy after more🩸#Crypto #BTC,0,0,DeepShAIte,266,1500606379400183808
